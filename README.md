This is a small web application to visualize my bike rides on a map using django and the bootstrap and leaflet javascript libraries. The tracks are recorded using my Garmin bike computer.

The running web application can be found on [bike.jochenklar.de](http://bike.jochenklar.de "bike.jochenklar.de").

If you want to run the app you need to copy `bike/default.settings.py` to `bike/settings.py` first.
